This is a working chatGPT app which is an interactive application that uses openAI API. It serves as a user-friendly interface for interacting with the underlying AI model.

The app allows users to input text-based queries or statements, and the chatGPT model processes and generates human-like responses based on the input.

Key features of this chatGPT app includes:

    Input Interface: The app provides a text input field or chatbox where users can type or enter their queries, messages, or prompts.

    User Context: The app maintains a conversational context, allowing the chatGPT model to generate responses that take into account the history of the             
    conversation. This enables a more coherent and context-aware conversation.

    Response Generation: The app sends user inputs to the chatGPT model, which generates responses based on the input and the conversation context. The responses aim     to be informative, helpful, and coherent.

    Real-Time Interaction: The app facilitates real-time interaction, where users receive immediate responses as they enter their queries. This creates a         
    conversational experience that mimics human-like interactions.
